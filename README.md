# Explore-NYSE-financial-data
MS Excel is being used to analyze real life financial data from the New York Stock Exchange.

# Project Overview
I analyzed historical financial data from S&P 500 companies for this project. As part of my work, I developed a financial forecasting model, a report, and dynamic dashboards within a spreadsheet program. 

# The Dataset
In this project I used a subset of a large dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse). The following information is included in the projectdata-nyse.csv file:
- Ticker symbol: Stock symbol
- Years: Number of years for which data is provided
- Period ending
- Total revenue
- Cost of goods sold
- Sales, General, and Administrative expenses
- Research and Development expenses
- Other Operating expense items
- Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Sector: The industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., American Airlines with the ticker symbol AAL is categorized under Industrials.)
- GICS Sub Industry: Sub-industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., AAL is further categorized under the sub-category of the "Airlines" industry.)

# The Outcomes
- An analysis of the data was conducted and a presentation was prepared to share the results
- Created a dashboard for a profit and loss statement
- Developed a financial forecasting model based on three scenarios

The resultes are presented in the folloeing files:
 -nyse_project.pdf - the presentation with the visuals and summary
 -nyse_project.xlsx - spreadsheet workbook used to do the analysis for the report containing the following tabs:
   - Data file
   - Summary statistics
   - P&L Statement Dashboard
   - Forecast scenarios

# The Interactive Experience
A dashboard created for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list. The drop-down list pulls historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement. The P&L statement includes the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, and EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.
A financial model created for a company of user choice that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, and EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case, and Base case). The forecasting model is dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong) and for the chosen company sticker symbol.
